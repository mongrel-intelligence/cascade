> **Cascade orchestrates AI agents (Claude Code, Codex, opencode, LLMist) across your workflows in GitHub, Trello, and Jira.**

Cascade is an open-source platform that automates the full software development lifecycle. Connect your PM tool and GitHub repository, and Cascade drives work items from plan to merge:

```
PM Card → Split → Plan → Implement → PR → Review → Iterate → Merge
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mongrel-intelligence/cascade.git
cd cascade
cp .env.docker.example .env    # Edit if needed
bash setup.sh                  # Build, migrate, and start all services
docker compose exec dashboard node dist/tools/create-admin-user.mjs \
  --email admin@example.com --password changeme --name "Admin"
```

Open **http://localhost:3001** and log in with your admin credentials.

For the full setup walkthrough — projects, credentials, webhooks, and triggers — see **[Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md)**.

## ⚡ Features

- **Multi-PM support** — Works with Trello and JIRA out of the box
- **11 agent types** — Splitting, planning, implementation, review, debug, respond-to-review, respond-to-CI, and more
- **Dual-persona GitHub model** — Separate implementer and reviewer bot accounts to prevent feedback loops
- **Web dashboard + CLI** — Monitor runs, manage projects, configure triggers
- **Extensible trigger system** — Add new events without touching core logic
- **Pluggable agent engines** — `llmist` (default), `claude-code`, `codex`, and `opencode` built-in; easy to extend
- **Credential encryption** — AES-256-GCM encryption for all stored secrets
- **Agent resilience** — Built-in rate limiting, exponential-backoff retry, and context compaction

## 🏗️ Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/architecture.jpg" alt="CASCADE architecture diagram" />
</p>

Cascade runs as three independent services:

| Service | Entry Point | Role |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Router** | `src/router/index.ts` | Receives webhooks, enqueues jobs to Redis via BullMQ |
| **Worker** | `src/worker-entry.ts` | Processes one job per container, exits when done |
| **Dashboard** | `src/dashboard.ts` | Serves the API (tRPC) and web UI |

### 🤖 Agent Types

| Agent | Trigger | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `splitting` | PM status change | Splits a large card into smaller work items |
| `planning` | PM status change | Creates a detailed implementation plan on the card |
| `implementation` | PM status change | Writes code and opens a pull request |
| `review` | CI pass / PR opened / review requested | Reviews a pull request |
| `respond-to-review` | Reviewer requests changes | Addresses review feedback |
| `respond-to-ci` | CI failure | Diagnoses and fixes failing CI checks |
| `respond-to-pr-comment` | PR comment | Responds to comments on a PR |
| `respond-to-planning-comment` | Planning card comment | Updates the plan based on feedback |
| `debug` | Session log uploaded | Analyzes agent session logs and creates a debug card |
| `resolve-conflicts` | Merge conflict detected | Resolves git merge conflicts |
| `backlog-manager` | Scheduled / manual | Manages and prioritizes the backlog |

## 🛠️ Development

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 22+, PostgreSQL, Redis

```bash
npm install && cd web && npm install && cd ..
cp .env.example .env    # Set DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL
npm run db:migrate
```

Start each service in a separate terminal:

```bash
npm run dev                                           # Router (webhook receiver, :3000)
npm run build && node --env-file=.env dist/dashboard.js  # Dashboard API (:3001)
npm run dev:web                                       # Dashboard frontend (Vite, :5173)
```

> **Note:** The Vite dev server proxies `/trpc` and `/api` to `localhost:3001`, so the Dashboard API must be running for the frontend to work. See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md#running-the-dashboard) for more details.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm test` | Run unit tests (Vitest) |
| `npm run test:integration` | Run integration tests (requires PostgreSQL) |
| `npm run lint` | Check code style (Biome) |
| `npm run lint:fix` | Auto-fix lint issues |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript type checking |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript to `dist/` |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply pending migrations |
| `npm run db:studio` | Open Drizzle Studio |

---

## 🚢 Deployment

The included `docker-compose.yml` runs all services with a single command. Workers are spawned dynamically by the Router via Docker socket.

| Image | Dockerfile | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Dashboard + Frontend | `Dockerfile.selfhosted` | API server + web UI (combined) |
| Router | `Dockerfile.router` | Webhook receiver, worker orchestration |
| Worker | `Dockerfile.worker` | Full agent runtime (clones repos, runs AI) |

**Required production environment variables:**

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/cascade
REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-host:6379
CREDENTIAL_MASTER_KEY=<64-char hex>   # Generate: openssl rand -hex 32
```

All project-level credentials (GitHub tokens, PM keys, LLM API keys) are stored in the database and managed through the dashboard or CLI.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

**Dual-persona GitHub model** — Cascade uses two separate GitHub bot accounts per project (implementer and reviewer) to prevent feedback loops. The implementer writes code and creates PRs; the reviewer reviews and approves them.

**Trigger system** — Events from Trello, JIRA, and GitHub webhooks are matched against registered `TriggerHandler` instances. Triggers are configured per-project in the database.

**Agent engines** — Agents run through a shared execution lifecycle with a pluggable engine registry. Default engine is `llmist` (supports OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI). Alternatives: `claude-code` (Claude Code SDK), `codex` (OpenAI Codex CLI), `opencode` (OpenCode server).

**Credential management** — All secrets are stored in the `project_credentials` table, scoped to a project. Optional AES-256-GCM encryption via `CREDENTIAL_MASTER_KEY`.

**`.cascade/` directory** — Each target repository can include a `.cascade/` directory with hooks that control how the agent sets up the project, lints after edits, and runs tests. See **[`.cascade/` Directory Guide](./docs/cascade-directory.md)**.

For deeper documentation on all of these topics, see [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md).
